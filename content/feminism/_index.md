The feminist project is nothing if not ambitious. We live in a society in which which men: kill themselves, die earlier and are killed more often than women; comprise more than 80% of the homeless, and have less than 20% of homeless shelter spaces; achieve poorer educational outcomes and have lower average incomes after leaving school and college than women; and are incarcerated and executed more frequently for the same crimes than women.
