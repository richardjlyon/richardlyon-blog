{{< epigraph author="Janet Bloomfield" source="My Female Privilege">}}

I love my female privilege, that I can go to college campuses where I’m the majority, provided I take retarded subjects like film theory, women’s studies, dance therapy, or pottery. If I go into Science, Technology, Engineering, or Maths, well, then I’m a minority and I'm oppressed, and you’re the oppressor, and we have to fix it! by making sure I have more, and better, opportunities than you in college. I LOVE my female privilege.
