In <em>“Four Puzzles on Gender Equality”</em>[^1], Philippe Van Parijs of the Université Catholique de Louvain asks:

<blockquote class="small">
(1) If society gives men more money per unit of time while nature gives women more units of time, can it always be said that there is an unjust inequality at the expense of women?<br/><br/>
(2) If society gives men more money and women better education, can it always be said that there is an unjust inequality at the expense of women?<br/><br/>
(3) If men enjoys a majority among power holders and women a majority among those who choose the power holders, can it always be said that there is an unjust inequality at the expense of women?<br/><br/>
(4) If men’s genetic endowment makes its members more likely to end up in prison, can this ever be counted as an injustice suffered by its members, none of whom chose not to be born a member of the less incarceration-prone women?
</blockquote>

The feminist project is nothing if not ambitious. Their claim that a society in which men die and kill themselves earlier than women, achieve poorer educational outcomes then women, and are incarcerated and executed more frequently for the same crimes than women, is organised by men for their own benefit is courageous.
