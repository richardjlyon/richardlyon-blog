<strong>Exhibit 1 </strong>In her report to her 'stakeholders', Alison Saunders, [Director of Prosecutions](https://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html) at the Crown Prosecution Service, notes her 'pleasure'[^1] (sic) at an 11% increase in Violence Against Women and Girls convictions, having previously ordered a 50% increase in VAWG caseload. She highlights the recent revision to the <em>Code of Practice on Adult Conditional Cautions</em> authorising police officers to relieve women of the burden of referral to the CPS for prosecution under the <em>Women Specific Condition</em>; notes, as Director of Prosecution, the mitigating effect of the problem of drug and alcohol misuse and self-harm on the need to make such provision; and notes the Ministry of Justice's strategic priorities for female offenders, including enhanced provision in the community, and transforming rehabilitation that recognises womens needs. Finally, she notes the 'immense' assistance, support, and leadership stakeholders are permitted in 'every area' of its role.

The amendment further seeks to deny the judge her right to exercise her judgement in the matter. The outcome, in the opinion of expert legal opinion[^2], will be a significant rise in grotesque injustice, and violation of mens' rights currently protected by the European Human Rights Act.
