TO RECAP: I'm obliged to install a fence-and-flap arrangement to prevent any construction work from disturbing the equanimity of my stripy friends.

But being similar in scale to the Maginot Line, the installation of the fence itself presents a considerable disturbance in the Badger Force.

Since any potentially disturbing work must be licensed by Scottish Natural Heritage, and since such a license can only be granted _after_ Badgers have been protected, a _non sequitur_ has arisen in which it is not entirely clear how to proceed.

As a result, something of a lacuna is occurring in matters Badger.

So, to pass the time, a Badger poem:

**Badgers!**
<pre>Happy days are here again!
Time for Badgers armed with pen
To march toward the shores of Night,
Not fearing all the Evil Ducks
That hide beside the road in trucks.

For Badgers hold a secret Light -
Fluorescent peanuts they have brought
(A Belgian brand, and widely sought).

And should an Evil Duck stray by,
Beware! For Badgers, quick to think,
Will swiftly arm themselves with ink
And poke a biro in its eye.

- Gareth Taylor</pre>

We still have trees and bats to negotiate. I'm very much looking forward to, you know, building something.
