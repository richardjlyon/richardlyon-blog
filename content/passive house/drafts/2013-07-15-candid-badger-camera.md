Keen to understand my striped neighbours and their needs a little better, I arrange to meet Tricia and John from Edinburgh and Lothian Badgers Group at Kingswood, to look for faeces and snuffle holes in the company of a practiced eye.

Yep. Badgers. We find hair, scratched up weeds, and quite a bit of evidence of general Badger to-ing and fro-ing. The colossal hole in the wall is, according to John, likely to be Badgers – they are very strong, he says. I think it more likely to be the work of Badger accomplices, but feel it wiser to keep my opinions to myself (and now, the entire internet).

We discuss Badger Fences, Badger Gates, and Badger Corridors.

The Badger Fence keeps the Badgers out of the garden. Is has to be constructed to what feels like Berlin wall specifications. There is a European Standard for [Badger proof fence wire](http://www.wildlifeservices.co.uk/badgerfencing.html) which, at £315 for 50 metres, is a steal.

The [Badger Gate](http://www.wildlifeservices.co.uk/badgergates.html) is a solid metal flap in the fence, like a cat flap. One will let the badgers through the wall (after I've dropped £1,000 repairing the peculiarly specific damage, of course). Another one way gate lets Badgers that have come into the garden through the front gate get back to the sett.

The rationale for the Badger Corridor, which John and Tricia seem particularly keen on, is a mystery to me. The North border of the property sits at the edge of Barnton Quarry, and my property consequently divides the forest in which it sits in two. The Badgers pass between the East and West sections of the forest along the lip of this quarry. A collapse temporarily prevented this passage. The ever resourceful Badgers accommodated this setback by making the journey down the length of the property to Clermiston road, which forms the southern boundary. Whereupon they invariably meet their untimely death in the heavy traffic.

Then Edinburgh Council built a concrete Badger walkway above the quarry (at some unguessed cost to the tax payer), restoring the Badgers' full and free access to the West and East forests. But the Badgers still make the excursion, and meet their untimely deaths, in order to raid the dustbins of my future neighbours on the other side of the road.

John and Tricia would like me to construct a corridor the length of the garden to facilitate this journey. I opine that their deaths, while no less tragic, is now in a rather less noble cause, and not one which I feel inclined to subsidise. John and Tricia look at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon the peak in Corstorphine.

To break the silence, and in an attempt to recover a measure of Institutional approval, I ask if Edinburgh and Lothian Badgers Group would like to film the Badgers, and throw in a set of keys to the gate for good measure.

You can see the results above, which are very satisfying.
