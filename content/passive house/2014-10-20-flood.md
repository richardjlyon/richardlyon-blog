Day 1 - what a start.

Some weeks ago, we went to the Water Authority and said: "We're about to knock an old water tank down. Is it connected to any of your pipework?" "Oh no", they said, showing us the schematics, "it's completely disconnected". "Are you sure?", we asked. "Quite sure", they said.

This morning, we started knocking the old water tank down. The digger drove over an old pipe, creating a hairline fracture. It turns out the pipe - which was a nine inch mains pipe - was connected . You can see the result.

Within half an hour, an Engineer from the Water Authority arrived and shut off the mains. He told us that if we had broken the pipe fully, the flow of water would have closed the main road, and we would have been on national TV news.
