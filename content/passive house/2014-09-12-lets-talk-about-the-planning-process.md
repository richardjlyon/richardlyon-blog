**When it takes nine months to get planning permission, everyone loses.**

The UK planning process is not popular. Many claim that it is too slow, too unpredictable, and misaligned to real priorities.

The planning authority is obliged to make a decision within eight weeks of an application. They took forty.

Here's where some of the issues with the planning process have cropped up at Kingswood.

When I bought the land in 2013, there already was planning permission in place for the erection of a dwelling house.

To secure that planning permission, the previous owner had to satisfy the planning authority that badgers would not be affected, bats would not disturbed, trees would not be uprooted, traffic would not be blocked, archeologically and architecturally significant structures would not be disturbed, the natural landscape would not be degraded, and neighbours would not be unduly offended.

He did all of those things.

Let's be clear: Kingswood is not (yet) paradise. It is a 1920's concrete shoebox in an overgrown, semi-industrial site in which graffiti, beer tins, drug paraphernalia, and human excrement  accumulate.

The Kingswood proposal reduces the visual impact and the energy demand of the approved structure. It clears up an eyesore and contributes to the amenity of the area. And it injects a six-figure capital sum into the local economy at a time of significant economic uncertainty and job insecurity, supporting the formation of an entirely new construction sector.

Many would regard it as a "no-brainer".

Yet I have had to repeat a study of badgers which, since the last report, have decided to use the alternative route round the site provided for the purpose by the neighbouring property owner, and avoid mine entirely. The report confirms the recommendations of its predecessor, mandating what I have to do, if the badgers hadn't left, to protect them while I clear up the hypodermic needles.[1] Having provided the measures recommended by Scottish National Heritage's appointed experts, Scottish National Heritage express their amazement that I have done so, and are now in the process of confirming the sett's abandonment.

I've had to repeat a study of the bats, which confirms that the bats that weren't there before still aren't there now.

I've had to repeat a study of the trees, which confirms they are all roughly an inch taller.

I've had to conduct a noise survey of an acoustically sealed, actively ventilated house to evaluate what the noise level would have been like inside it if it had been designed with  windows that required opening for ventilation.[2]

All of it done in series, at glacial pace, and at astonishing cost.

To those readers considering building your own house: don't allow this to discourage you. With patience, and a fair chunk of the contingency pot, we got the right outcome. But do be prepared for it.

### Notes
[1] The [original recommendation]({% post_url 2013-07-15-candid-badger-camera %}) involved funnelling the badgers down the site so they could get killed on the main road.

[2] Some open for access and egress, which is a different matter. We were successful eventually in arguing the irrelevance of this requirement.
