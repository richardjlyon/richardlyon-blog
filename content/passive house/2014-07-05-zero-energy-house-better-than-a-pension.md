Your energy bill is not like your vacation bill. You can choose not to go on holiday. You can't choose not to heat your home. Reducing your energy bill by £1,000 is exactly like increasing your income by £1,000.

Matters get interesting when you work out how much of a pension lump sum that is equivalent to. Here's how it's done.

The average annual dual fuel energy bill in the UK is £1,420. It's currently rising at 10% a year as energy becomes scarcer[1].

Assume that increase can be reduced to only 5% per year. At that rate of increase, the average energy bill will be £3,100 a year by 2030 (the year I retire).

So I'd need £3,100 in the year I retire to fund my energy needs, and that amount would have to increase 5% a year so that I could keep funding my energy bill if it continued to increase at 5% a year.

Legal & General pension company will [let you estimate](http://www.legalandgeneral.com/annuities/pension-annuity/annuity-calculator/)  how much of a pension lump sum you'd need in 2030 to generate an income of £3,100 a year that increased at 5% per year.

It's £110,000.

So owning a zero energy home -- which eliminates my energy bill -- which is like having an income of £3,100 a year increasing at 5% a year -- is like having an extra £110,000 in your pension fund.

## A bird in the hand ...

But it's even more valuable than that.

UK pension funds are insolvent. The money that we are promised we will be paid when we retire has not been created yet. The people who promised us we would be paid have all assumed that, by the time we retired, the money necessary to fund our payments will be created by economic growth.

If the economy doesn't grow by that rate, the money that is supposed to fund our pension will never be created.

The economy is not growing by that rate. [Estimates vary](https://encrypted.google.com/#q=uk+pension+fund+gap), but by one estimate the shortfall for the public sector pension system alone is now over a trillion pounds[2].

So the £3,100 a year of pension income I'd need at retirement to fund my energy needs doesn't exist, and probably never will.

But the elimination of my £3,100 a year energy expenses exists now.

So not only does a zero energy house act like a pension, it acts like a guaranteed pension in a world where there will be no pensions at all.

Value that, Legal & General.
