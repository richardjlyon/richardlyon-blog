We started the groundworks today.

Three mature trees have to come down, and the site cleared of brush to allow access for construction vehicles.

One tree - a 30m beech - had to come down because it was weakened and might eventually have fallen on the house. The one next to it had to come down because the first one was holding it up and it would have fallen down as well.

The third was a real problem. It is a beautiful, healthy 30m beech tree. Its only fault was to sit in the entrance way to the site. The tree surveyor was concerned that site traffic driving over its root system might damage it, causing it to fall down eventually.

But my tree surgeon and architect looked at it, and agreed we can keep traffic sufficiently far from it that it can be saved. So we saved it. Now it will sit to the south of the property and filter the sunlight and traffic noise.

It's exciting because this is the first proper work towards building the house. I've had a few test pits dug to check for contamination, but this feels like 'proper' work.

I can't recommend Joe highly enough.
