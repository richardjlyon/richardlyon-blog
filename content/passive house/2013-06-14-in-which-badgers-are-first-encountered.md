Badgers (_Meles meles_) are protected under the _Protection of Badgers Act 1992_, i.e.

> Protected from being disturbed, killed, injured or taken and their setts from obstruction, damage or destruction.

Thus, as some spend up to Â£1,311 per Badger to engage a few hundred miles away in their wholesale, [State licensed slaughter](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25719562), I am obliged by the same State to spend similar amounts in pursuit and defence of their welfare. Not for the last time I suspect, Dear Reader,  will we have cause to reflect in these diaries upon the rich and curious tapestry of this country's institutions.

Kingswood Badgers are rather more fortunate than their Gloucestershire cousins, and their welfare is defended by any number of interested bodies. [Scottish Natural Heritage](http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/protected-species/which-and-how/mammals/badger-protection/) have plenty to say on the legal protections they are afforded, noting that the extensive list of menaces through which they pursue offenders is "not comprehensive". Meanwhile, [Lothian and Borders Badger Group](http://www.lbbg.org.uk) (not to be confused with _Scottish Badgers_ or _The National Federation of Badger Groups_) note their vital role in gathering and providing evidence for prosecutions.

Naturally, a study is required, at a price that is invariably hard to reconcile with the scope undertaken. In this case, _Grampian Badger Surveys_ were commissioned in December 2004 by the previous landowner to _"determine areas of badger activity relevant to the proposed development"_ and _"configure a prescription of measures to facilitate the development and protect the welfare of the species"_.

They looked for faeces, scratching posts, hair traces, and snuffle holes. They found them.

As a result, I'm obliged now to provide access into and through the site in such a way as to safeguard badger travel. Before any work commences within 30 metres of the setts (there are two), a license must be obtained from SNH. And, of course, Grampian Badger Surveys will be required to conduct the entire survey all over again immediately prior to site preparation or building work to _"maximise the chances of avoiding expensive delays"._

I've joined Lothian and Borders Badger Group.
