Two thirds of all the energy consumed in the world comes from hydrocarbon sources — coal, oil, and gas.

The major systems that support our way of life — industrial agriculture, global industrial manufacturing, global transportation — only work with those hydrocarbon energy sources.

There are four, very serious problems with that arrangement.

## Batteries not included

The first problem is that no other energy sources provide the combination of energy density, transportability, stability, convertibility and energy ‘profit’ that our life support systems depend on.

Our industrial manufacturing and global transportation systems, upon which the manufacture of solar and wind devices depends, can’t run on electricity.

_There is no combination of alternative energy technologies (wind, solar, wave, etc.)  technologies that can power the manufacturing system all alternative energy technologies require_ [1].


## Food

The second problem is that we use hydrocarbon to boost the amount of food available to us through irrigation, fertilisers, pesticides, refrigeration, transportation and processing. Those inputs can’t be replaced by electricity either.

_If hydrocarbon supplies fall, our food supply falls_.

## Fuel warning light

The third problem is that the quantity of hydrocarbon energy available to us has reached its all time peak and is now starting to decline at an accelerating rate.

## Is it hot in here?

And the fourth problem is that our atmosphere has reached the limit of its ability to absorb the carbon dioxide that is emitted when hydrocarbon is burned. Daily measurements of CO2 now exceed 400 parts per million for the first time in three million years [2].

The International Energy Agency warned (two years ago) that we are headed for irreversible climate change in five years [3].

_If hydrocarbon energy source use doesn't fall, we'll fry ourselves._

## Zero energy homes demand less

Although we act as though we are free to ignore the limit imposed by our atmosphere, it is the fact that supplies are now contracting which we are not free to ignore in the short term. That is what propels this from a theoretical problem in the distant future to one which will affect us in the timescale of a mortgage.

The first problem — the inability of renewable energy technologies to power their own manufacturing processes — mean there can be no renewable energy solution to this issue. Without hydrocarbon, we can’t build renewable energy devices, or feed ourselves. Burning it will create changes in our climate which many experts believe will have catastrophic effects on our welfare.

Together with the third and fourth problems — the inability to find more carbon energy sources, or burn them if we could — means there is no supply solution to this problem.

Supply must balance demand. If supply falls, demand must fall. Since supply is falling, the only rational (or possible) response  is to radically reduce demand.

And since the largest demand for energy most of us make in our lives is through our homes, the only rational step we can take is to reduce the energy required *by* our homes.

And that is why I'm building a passive house.
