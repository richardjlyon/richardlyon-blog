In German legend, magician and alchemist Faust signs a deal with the devil. The devil grants him knowledge and power, for a period. Then the devil takes his soul. Faust discovers the problem inherent in all deals done for present gain without consideration of future consequence.

Nuclear Energy is a deal with the devil. Deconstructing the deal is simple:

1. Nuclear energy is necessary (they say) because, without it, energy will become unaffordable, then intermittent, then unavailable.

2. Nuclear energy produces deadly waste products which persist over timescales measured in thousands of years. During this period, they must be cooled continuously to prevent the heat created by their radiation causing them to spontaneously combust and explode.

3. This cooling process demands large quantities of energy which must be ... affordable and uninterrupted.

If nuclear technology is to replace even a modest fraction of energy currently provided by hydrocarbon, the quantity of waste will have to increase by orders of magnitude. Can we provide an affordable, uninterrupted power supply for thousands of years to prevent thousands of waste dump sites exploding and irradiating everything around them?

Not that we can see. The cooling energy requirement for this first 1% of the nuclear industry's waste persistence period has been provided by the temporary energy surplus afforded by our brief hydrocarbon energy interval. It is precisely because this interval is ending that we are forced to consider nuclear energy at all.

The energy cost of extracting nuclear fuel from rapidly deteriorating ore quality is already approaching the threshold below which the nuclear process isn't able to power its own fuel provisioning process. It can't power its own cooling requirements.

Renewable technologies are, without exception, the products of the global extensive, energy intensive manufacturing system which, unsubstitutably, runs on hydrocarbon energy surpluses. Worse, a renewable energy source which is capable of yielding a sufficient, uninterruptible source of energy after servicing its own technology's manufacturing, operating and fuel provisioning requirements is inconsistent with our current understanding of thermodynamics.

So energy policy is revealed, in this instance, to be the crossed fingers of 'experts' assuming that a miracle technology will be devised to prevent the explosion of the waste through the provision of large quantities of uninterrupted, affordable energy over thousands of years, or that we will abandon this irradiated planet and head for the stars.

Unless you believe in science fiction energy devices, or interstellar programs founded on wind and solar powered gravitational escape devices, the nuclear energy proposition is a Faustian bargain.
